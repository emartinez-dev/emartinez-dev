### Hello!👋 

I am Enrique Martínez. I am a Business Management and Administration graduate, tech lover, and self-taught developer. 

I have helped world-renowned brands and startups in competitive SEO sectors for three years as Digital Marketing Consultant. During that period, I fell in love with Python and discovered the power of data, so I decided to redirect my career path toward programming.

After two years of self-taught learning, I decided to jump into the ["pool"](https://github.com/emartinez-dev/42malaga-piscinaAgosto) and join 42 School, one of the most innovative schools based on peer-to-peer learning.

🔭 Currently working on [my 42 cursus projects](https://github.com/emartinez-dev/42cursus)

🌱  Computer science student @ **[42 Málaga](https://42malaga.com/)** since September 2022.

👨‍💻  I am interested in  `Python`,  `Data Mining`,  `Machine Learning` and  `Peer Learning`!
